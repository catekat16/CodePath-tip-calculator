# Pre-work - *Tippy*

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Dark Mode

## Notes

During the process of building the tip calculator, I was introduced to Swift and navigating XCode. It was my first time developing a mobile app and I am very surprised that it isn't as intimidating as it seemed. Looming forward to exploring app development more! 

I really wished I could have more free time to add on some optional features-- hopefully I can be able to participate in CodePath's course. Super grateful for this opportunity!
